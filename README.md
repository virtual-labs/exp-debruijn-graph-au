### About the Experiment 

The experiment "Construction of De Bruijn Graphs for Sequence Assembly" focuses on understanding a fundamental technique used in genome sequencing. In this experiment, students learn how short DNA sequence fragments (called reads) can be organized and connected using De Bruijn graphs. By breaking sequences into smaller overlapping parts called k-mers, and linking them based on these overlaps, the De Bruijn graph helps to efficiently reconstruct the original DNA sequence. This approach is widely used in modern sequencing technologies to assemble large and complex genomes.
